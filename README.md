### 😣 LONG SUMMARY:
Growing up my vision was to become a chartered accountant at one of the Big Four accounting firms in South Africa. What drove my decision at the time was my keen interest in mathematics and financial accounting. I had a natural aptitude for understanding and making sense of numbers. However, this vision was short-lived when I began taking a liking to computer programming with a focus on statistical analysis.
So my journey commenced with me pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Economic Sciences at the University of Stellenbosch. Not only did this qualification propel me to pursue a career in the corporate space, but it also equipped me with the necessary technical skills to showcase my professionalism.

My time in financial services provided me with key insights into the industry. Coupled with the world-class training I received I was fortunate enough to have an abundance of resources at my disposal. I wanted to understand how data could better assist me and the client in achieving the most desirable outcome.

Owing to my creativity I enjoy developing websites which is satisfying when it runs perfectly across multiple devices. It is so astonishing to witness how one can transform a static web page into a dynamic website.
